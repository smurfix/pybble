Test: Add support for coverage

Allow a template to selectively override one on its parent
	* store the current context and the object where the template was found at
	* a recursing search will simply continue at obj.parent

Limit MIME types for storage
	* assign permissions for adding (mimetype+storage+site)
	* only types with ADD permission are shown

Use foreign keys for permission handling

Cache the damn permissions

add g.context and current_app.context, for variables to add to all translators

translators: add config variables
	* ConfigVar at the translator
	* SiteConfigVar on any node between anchor and site (not just the template attachment point)

rename "translator" to "renderer"

multi language

move to flask and flask.ext.* idioms

add object deletion
	* clean up references to marked-as-deleted objects
	* then really delete them

sql_diff:
	varchar(>65535) vs. mediumtext/longtext
	index drop+create dance
