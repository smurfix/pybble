Installing pybble
=================

if your favorite Linux distribution has ``pybble`` pre-packaged, simply
install it. Debian:

	apt-get install pybble

If not, 
	apt-get install git pip
	pip install pybble

You can of course use ``virtualenv`` to run ``pybble`` in its own Python
tree. See the virtualenv documentation for details.
