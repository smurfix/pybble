# Pybble overview

Pybble is a light-weight, flexible content manager for small Web sites.

## Object model

All of Pybble's objects have up to three "parents".

* parent: the immediate ancestor.

* superparent: the next-level ancestor.

* owner: typically the user who created the record.

All of these are either missing, or are themselves objects.

For instance, consider a Wiki page A, which has a comment B, which has a
comment C. The parent (and superparent) of B is A. The parent of C is B.
The superparent of C is also A. The owner records point to the users
who created these pages.

Typically, a web page contains links to all of its children.

If you follow parent pointers, you reach a site record, which contains
the name and domain of the web space it's controlling. Site records may
have other sites as their parent, up to the initial system root which is
created when the system is set up initially.

You should start by setting up the database. There are mysql and sqlite3
SQL files. Right now you need

	python manage.py initsite
